# Color_detection_project
Program to detect the color of a particular coordinate of the image(which is single left clicked)

This has been created using pandas and opencv module

the pandas module have been used to access the data of the csv file namely colors.csv

the opencv module has been used to access the image and while displaying the image, to also show the RGB color code and color name of the coordinate of the image where the user has single clicked. The rectangular box in which the data is shown will be of the same color which is being displayed in text in the rectangular box.

All the files have to be present in the same folder else the path to the image and the csv file has to be mentioned inside the program.

Use the pixcol.jpg file for multiple color options
